## Cannot Connect Headset
Press and hold the headset button until the headset voice prompts "Connect to Bluetooth" and then release it. At this time, the headset indicator light should be flashing blue.
* If you press and hold the button, there is no voice announcement or the indicator light does not light up, please charge the headband for more than 10 minutes and try again.
* If your phone is an Android phone, please allow the applet to have location permission before connecting. Click here to view [How to enable location permission](/instructions/enable-location-permission).
* Make sure to wear your head near the phone.
* Other Bluetooth devices may interfere with the connection when connecting with the applet. Please stay away from them.
* If you can't connect, please switch the phone's Bluetooth once and try again. Click here to view here [How to switch Bluetooth](/instructions/turn-on-bluetooth).
* Try to connect the headset again. If it still does not work, please restart the phone and try again.
* If you have tried all the above tips, but the headband still does not work, please feel free to contact us through your dedicated customer service.

## 无法连接头戴，怎么办？
* 按住头戴按键，直至头戴语音提示「连接蓝牙」再放开，此时头戴指示灯应为蓝色闪烁状态。
* 如果长按按键，没有语音播报或者指示灯没有亮，请给头环充电 10 分钟以上再试。
* 如果您的手机是安卓手机，请在连接前允许小程序拥有定位权限。点击这里查看[如何开启定位权限](/instructions/enable-location-permission)。
* 确保头戴在手机附近。
* 其他蓝牙设备在与小程序连接时可能会干扰连接。请远离它们。
* 如果无法连接，请开关一次手机蓝牙，然后再重试。点击这里查看这里[如何开关蓝牙](/instructions/turn-on-bluetooth)。
* 尝试再次连接头戴。如果依旧不行，请重启手机后再尝试。
* 如果您已经尝试了上述所有提示，但头环仍然不能正常工作，请随时通过您的专属客服联系我们。
