## How to assemble sponge pads
- Remove the ring buckles that are magnetically attached to the inner sides of the two discs.
- Take out a pack of sponges from the box, tear open the package, and take out the two sponge sheets in the package (do not twist/suck out the liquid infiltrating the sponge).
- Insert the sponge pieces into the circular sponge grooves on the inner sides of the left and right discs of the headwear, and cover the edges of the sponge pieces with the removed ring buckles, and then attach them to the discs to fix the sponge pieces. Rotate the buckle until the suction force is reached. Biggest place.
- The two sides of a sponge pad are the same.
