## 「Press to Have Better Contact」
When the pads are not in full contact with the scalp, the headset says 「Press to Have Better Contact」, which means you need to press the headset continuously to make the conductive fluid wet the scalp until the contact is good. Users who have thick hair can move the headset to the vicinity of the hairline to increase contact.
