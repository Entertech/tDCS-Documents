## Is it normal for optical illusion during use?
There was a sudden 「flash」during use, which is most likely caused by improper operations that did not follow the instructions (such as sudden removal of the device during activation). This is a momentary optical illusion caused by a sudden increase or decrease of current, and it is harmless.
