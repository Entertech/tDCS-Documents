## How to Turn on/off the Headset?

- Turn on and enter the stimulation mode: When it's off, press and hold the headset key, and release it when you hear the music. When the headset is in stimulation mode, the indicator next to the headset key will turn blue. Shortly, the headset will say, "Fix the pads. Position the headset in place. And press the key to start stimulation."
- Turn on and enter the Bluetooth connection mode: When it's off, press and hold the key. Don't release it until you hear "Bluetooth ready to connect." Don't release the key even you hear the power-on music. Otherwise, the Bluetooth connection mode is not active.
- Shutdown: When the headset is on, press and hold the key, and you'll hear shutoff music.
- Auto shutdown: The headset will automatically power off if it is not active for more than 5 minutes.
