## How to Fix Sponge Pads?
- Take off the magnetic rings that are magnetically attached to two headset rings.
- Take out a pack of sponge pads.
- Place one pad on each headset ring. Put magnetic rings back, and rotate the magnetic rings when you feel it's clung tightly.
- There is no front or back side of the pads.
