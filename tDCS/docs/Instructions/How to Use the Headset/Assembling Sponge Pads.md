## How to Fix Sponge Pads?
- Prepare saline in the bottle provided.
  - Fill the spoon provided with table salt and pour salt in the bottle. 
  - Fill the bottle with warm water to the 100 ml mark. 
  - Close the lid and shake the bottle to dissolve the salt.
- Wet sponge pads.
  - Put two dry sponge pads into the round container.
  - Add 10 ml of saline to two pads.
  - Press the wet pads so that they are evenly and fully moist.
  - Gently squeeze the pads to remove excess salt water so that they are not dripping wet.
- Take off the magnetic rings that are magnetically attached to two headset rings.
- Place one pad on each headset ring. Put magnetic rings back, and rotate the magnetic rings when you feel it's clung tightly.
- There is no front or back side of the pads.
