## How to Modify the Current?

-When it is not activated, you can click "Set activation strength" on the homepage of the Mini Program to modify it.
-If you want to modify the activation intensity during activation, you need to end the activation first, and then enter the applet for setting. To end the activation early, please refer to [How to end the activation early](/instructions/end-stimulating).
