## How to End a Sessionï¼Ÿ

During the stimulation, you can press the headset key to pause the session. Don't take off the headset before you hear a beep. After you remove the headset, you can press and hold the headset key to shut it down.

How to pause? Please refer to [How to Pause the Session](/instructions/pause-stimulating).
