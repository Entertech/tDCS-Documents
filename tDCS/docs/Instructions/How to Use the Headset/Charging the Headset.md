## Charge the Headset

- If the headset says「Low battery. Please charge」 and shuts down automatically, the headset has a low battery and has to be charged before next use.
- Connect the headset to a power adapter via the USB Type-C cable. There is no special requirement for the power adapter. Just a standard mobile phone power adapter is OK.
- Charging: If the headset is not fully charged, the indicator light on the headset will turn red.
Once fully charged, the indicator light will turn green.
- Generally, it takes 2 hours to charge the battery fully. When the battery is too low to start a session, charge it for 10 minutes, and it has the battery for a 30-minute session.
