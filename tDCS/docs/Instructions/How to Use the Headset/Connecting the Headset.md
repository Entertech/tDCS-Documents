## How to Connect the Headset?
* If the headset is off, press and hold the key. Don't release it until you hear "Bluetooth ready to connect." Don't release the key even you hear the power-on music. Otherwise, the Bluetooth connection mode is not active.
* After it's in the Bluetooth connection mode, the indicator next to the headset button flashes blue.
* Follow the instructions in the app to connect the headset.
* After the connection is successful, the headset will say "Bluetooth Connected".
