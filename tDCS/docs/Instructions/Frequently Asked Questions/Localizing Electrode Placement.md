## Localizing Electrode Placement
* The activation site of the Flowtime tDCS headset is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is part of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The prefrontal cortex is the cortex that covers the frontal lobe. It is the latest mature structure in an individual, accounting for about 29% of the entire adult cerebral cortex. As a key brain area for many advanced cognitive functions, DLPFC has extensive neural projection connections with subcortical structures, related to functions such as working memory, rule learning, planning, attention and motivation.
