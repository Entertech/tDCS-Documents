## How to Relieve Skin Itching or Tingling?
- Some users may experience slight skin itching or tingling. This is safe and can be relieved by pressing the pads to have a better contact or reduce the current strength.
- Some irritation is caused by acne or other injuries of the contacted skin. If you feel pain before reaching the minimum current intensity, you can pause and take off the device. Check any skin injury around the stimulation sites, and wear the headset after confirming the skin is intact.
- You can also reduce the current intensity. Please refer to [Modifying the Current](/instructions/change-intensity).
