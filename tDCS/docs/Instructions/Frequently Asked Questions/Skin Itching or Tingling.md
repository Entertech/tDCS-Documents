## How to Relieve Skin Itching or Tingling?
* Some users may experience slight skin itching or tingling. This is safe and can be relieved by pressing the sponge to increase contact or reduce the activation intensity.
* Some irritation is caused by acne or other injury of the contacted skin. If you feel pain before reaching the minimum activation intensity, you can pause and take off the device, check the activation site for skin injury, rewear the headset after confirming that contacted skin is intact.
* You can also reduce the activation intensity, please refer to [Modifying the Current](/instructions/change-intensity).
