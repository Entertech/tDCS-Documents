## What Does"Rewear it to Have Better Contact" Mean?
If high resistance is detected, which means almost no contact between the headset and the scalp, the headset will say "Rewear it to Have Better Contact." Please fix the hair and rewear the headset till it says the contact is good. If you have thick hair, it also works if you move the pads near the hairline to have better contact.
