## Electrode Placements (Montages)
The stimulation sites of the Flowtime tDCS headset are designed to be the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is part of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and motor cortex. The prefrontal cortex is the cortex that covers the frontal lobe. It is the latest mature structure in human beings, accounting for about 29% of the entire adult cerebral cortex. As a key brain area for many advanced cognitive functions, DLPFC has extensive neural projection connections with subcortical structures, related to functions such as attention, working memory and motivation.
