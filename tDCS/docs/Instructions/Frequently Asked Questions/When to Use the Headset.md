## When to Use the Headset?
The Flowtime tDCS headset is a neuromodulation product based on tDCS to improve learning memory. The neuromodulation effect of the Flowtime tDCS headset is 「functionally targeted」, which means it promotes the activation of activated neural circuits (neural circuits where neurons that receive massive synaptic inputs and are so depolarized that they occasionally (or often) generate action potentials), and has almost no effect on  「passive」 neurons (neurons whose membrane voltage is not close to the threshold for action potential generation). Such effect can last for 60-90 minutes after a Flowtime tDCS session.
