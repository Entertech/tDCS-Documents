## When to Use the Headset?
The Flowtime tDCS headset is a neuromodulation product based on tDCS technology to improve attention, memory, mood, and performance. The neuromodulation effect of the Flowtime tDCS headset is「functionally targeted」, which means it promotes the excitement of activated neural circuits (neural circuits where neurons that receive massive synaptic inputs and are so depolarized that they occasionally (or often) generate action potentials) and has almost no effect on「passive」neurons (neurons whose membrane voltage is not close to the threshold for action potential generation). 

So we suggest you use Flowtime tDCS when you just start to do a task, like learning, writing, reading, gaming, etc. Such effect will last for 60-90 minutes after you finish the session.
