## Connection Failed
Press and hold the headset button until the headset voice prompts "Connect to Bluetooth" and then release it. At this time, the headset indicator light should be flashing blue.
* If you press and hold the button, there is no voice announcement or the indicator light does not light up, please charge the headband for more than 10 minutes and try again.
* If your phone is an Android phone, please allow the applet to have location permission before connecting. Click here to view [How to enable location permission](/instructions/enable-location-permission).
* Make sure to wear your head near the phone.
* Other Bluetooth devices may interfere with the connection when connecting with the applet. Please stay away from them.
* If you can't connect, please switch the phone's Bluetooth once and try again. Click here to view here [How to switch Bluetooth](/instructions/turn-on-bluetooth).
* Try to connect the headset again. If it still does not work, please restart the phone and try again.
* If you have tried all the above tips, but the headband still does not work, please feel free to contact us through your dedicated customer service.
