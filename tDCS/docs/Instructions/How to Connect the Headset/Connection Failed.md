## What Should I Do if Connection Failed
- Press and hold the key until the headset voice says "Bluetooth ready to connect".The indicator light flashes blue.
- If there is no voice announcement or the indicator light does not light up, please charge the headband for more than 10 minutes and try again.
- Make sure to have your phone nearby.
- Other Bluetooth devices may interfere with the connection process. Please keep them away.
- If the connection still fails, please go to setting and restart Bluetooth. And try again.
- If it still does not work, please restart the phone and try again.
