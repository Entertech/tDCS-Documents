## Is it normal for optical illusion during use?
<!---使用过程中出现光幻视正常吗？--->
There was a sudden 「flash」during use, which is most likely caused by improper operations that did not follow the instructions (such as sudden removal of the device during activation). This is a momentary optical illusion caused by a sudden increase or decrease of current, and it is harmless.
<!---使用过程中眼前突然「闪了一下」，这很有可能是由于未遵循使用说明的不当操作（比如激活过程中突然摘下设备）引起的。这是突然增大或减小的电流引起的瞬间的光幻视现象，是安全的。--->
